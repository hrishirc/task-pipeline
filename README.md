# task-pipeline
Java-based Task Pipeline Framework for Backend Workflows.

Please try it if you can. Also give suggestions if possible. I can also add you as a contributor.

TaskPipeline.java - Implementation of Task Pipeline to execute series of sequential linked steps which takes an input, does some work and returns some output. 

Job.java - Base Interface which uses TaskPipeline.java to provide a framework for standard backend operations 

SampleJobImpl.java - Reference Implementation of Job.java

NOTE : This currently is a plain vanilla version. I plan to integrate it with Spring when I get time. Also need to improve documentation which is currently non-existent
